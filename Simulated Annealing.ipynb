    "This is a comprehensive project focused on the Single Allocation p-Hub Location Problem (SApHLP) with flow-dependent cost. The p-Hub Location Problem is a classic optimization issue in operations research, specifically in transportation and logistics, where the goal is to determine optimal locations for hub facilities to minimize costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SApHLP studied here aims to optimize the allocation of existing demand to the chosen hubs, while considering the inherent economies of scale present in inter-hub connections. In this particular context, the total number of hub facilities to be opened is pre-defined, resulting in a fixed number of possible solutions to the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The study utilizes benchmark problems derived from CAB (25 nodes), TR (55&81 nodes), and Randomly Generated Problems (RGP-100 nodes) datasets. Algorithms were run 10 times for each test problem, with varying initial solutions, ensuring a robust and thorough testing process.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project incorporates the Simulated Annealing, a meta-heuristic method, inspired by the cooling process of metals, to solve the Single Allocation p-Hub Location Problem (SApHLP). The algorithm seeks an optimal or near-optimal solution for the strategic placement of hub facilities, while also considering the economies of scale in inter-hub connections."
